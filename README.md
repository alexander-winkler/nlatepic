# Database of Neo-Latin Epic Poems

There has been considerable progress in the field of Neo-Latin epic poetry in recent years. This very basic database aims at bringing together the titles that have been mentioned in various overviews on the topic (Braun 2007, Braun 2020, Hofmann 2001, @gwynneEpic2017).

I have also created a public [zotero group on Neo-Latin epic poetry](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2680665/neolatin_epic). Feel free to contribute!

The very defition of 'epic poetry' is far from clear and undisputed. Most epic poems are longish narrative texts in hexameters. However, shorter narrative poems can also qualify as 'epic' poems (they can also be referred to as 'epyllia', an equally problematic term). There are even narrative texts in the elegiac metre that some might consider 'epic', e.g. Bargaeus' 'De Radagasi caede elegia'. 

Currently, the data is stored in a simple `csv` file (`works.csv`) that can be viewed on github or downloaded and viewed in libreoffice Calc or Excel. I am still trying to find out which categories are useful in order to efficiently describe the texts in the corpus. I try to add authority file ids to the authors and bibliographic ids to the prints in order to make them more easily retrievable.

The bibliographic references use the Zotero citation keys from the collection mentioned above.

# Todo

* Look through IJsewijn/Sacr√© 1998 and other overviews and add data.
* Create frontend (maybe similar to [Catalogue of Critical Editions](https://dig-ed-cat.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/browsing/editions/), open source on [github](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dig_ed_cat)). Maybe the [json-editor](https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor) can be adapted.
